## Task Description:
Create a realtime search box, where users search articles, and then to have analytics that display what users were searching for. You can also track via IP - no need to create a devise, etc.

Your goal is to record their input in realtime and ultimately display analytics & trends on what people are searching for the most. (this is not about search itself, but really about analytics behind it). 

Hint: Because the search is real time, queries will be coming in segments, as listed in the example below


### Standards:
- TEST. Your. App.
- GOOD Code. We canâ€™t stress this enough. 
- Documented code. We donâ€™t expect you to write a novel, but at least remove the default Rails README
- Scalability 
- Deploy on Heroku or w/e for easier testing. Remember, itâ€™s all about making the userâ€™s life easier (in this case, us -- reviewing your code)
